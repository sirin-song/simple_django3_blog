1. Signing up with email activation link (token-based).
2. Logging in.
3. Displaying of all blog entries with pagination.
4. Comments adding (pre-moderated)
5. Markup tags in blog entry body.

What will be done:

1. Blog entries editing (only for author, only for short time)
2. Email message when there are a comment to your blog entry.
3. Simple wysywig editor for posts (maybe Summertime?)
